          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p My experience runs from UX-Design and Concept Development on one end of the spectrum, to Full-Stack Javascript and Front-End Developer on the other - So whether you need me to manage a large section of a project, or fill a specific role with a larger perspective and understanding within that spectrum, I am your man!
          p On the personal note, I enjoy the good challenge and learning opportunity, that allows me to polish my skills further, and even if my main interest lies in the field of Human Computer Interaction, I am all round just a happy worker!
